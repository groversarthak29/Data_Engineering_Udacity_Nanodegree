# Sparkify Postgres ETL

This is the first project submission for the Data Engineering Nanodegree.
This project consists on putting into practice the following concepts:
- Data modeling with Postgres
- Database star schema created 
- ETL pipeline using Python

## Context

A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. 
The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. 
Currently, they don't have an easy way to query their data, which resides in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

Your role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

### Data
- **Song datasets**: all json files are nested in subdirectories under */data/song_data*. A sample of this files is:

```
{"num_songs": 1, "artist_id": "ARJIE2Y1187B994AB7", "artist_latitude": null, "artist_longitude": null, "artist_location": "", "artist_name": "Line Renaud", "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", "duration": 152.92036, "year": 0}
```

- **Log datasets**: all json files are nested in subdirectories under */data/log_data*. A sample of a single row of each files is:

```
{"artist":"Slipknot","auth":"Logged In","firstName":"Aiden","gender":"M","itemInSession":0,"lastName":"Ramirez","length":192.57424,"level":"paid","location":"New York-Newark-Jersey City, NY-NJ-PA","method":"PUT","page":"NextSong","registration":1540283578796.0,"sessionId":19,"song":"Opium Of The People (Album Version)","status":200,"ts":1541639510796,"userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Windows NT 6.1) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"","userId":"20"}
```

## Database Schema
The schema used for this exercise is the Star Schema: 
There is one main fact table containing all the measures associated to each event (user song plays), 
and 4 dimentional tables, each with a primary key that is being referenced from the fact table.

On why to use a relational database for this case:
- The data types are structured (we know before-hand the sctructure of the jsons we need to analyze, and where and how to extract and transform each field)
- The amount of data we need to analyze is not big enough to require big data related solutions.
- Ability to use SQL that is more than enough for this kind of analysis
- Data needed to answer business questions can be modeled using simple ERD models
- We need to use JOINS for this scenario

#### Fact Table
**songplays** - records in log data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
- songplay_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of each user song play 
- start_time (DATE) NOT NULL: Timestamp of beggining of user activity
- user_id (INT) NOT NULL: ID of user
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}
- song_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Song played
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of Artist of the song played
- session_id (INT): ID of the user Session 
- location (TEXT): User location 
- user_agent (TEXT): Agent used by user to access Sparkify platform

#### Dimension Tables
**users** - users in the app
- user_id (INT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of user
- first_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of user
- last_name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Last Name of user
- gender (TEXT): Gender of user {M | F}
- level (TEXT): User level {free | paid}

**songs** - songs in music database
- song_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Song
- title (TEXT) NOT NULL: Title of Song
- artist_id (TEXT) NOT NULL: ID of song Artist
- year (INT): Year of song release
- duration (FLOAT) NOT NULL: Song duration in milliseconds

**artists** - artists in music database
- artist_id (TEXT) PRIMARY KEY: ID of Artist
- name (TEXT) NOT NULL: Name of Artist
- location (TEXT): Name of Artist city
- lattitude (FLOAT): Lattitude location of artist
- longitude (FLOAT): Longitude location of artist

**time** - timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
- start_time (DATE) PRIMARY KEY: Timestamp of row
- hour (INT): Hour associated to start_time
- day (INT): Day associated to start_time
- week (INT): Week of year associated to start_time
- month (INT): Month associated to start_time 
- year (INT): Year associated to start_time
- weekday (TEXT): Name of week day associated to start_time


## Project structure

Files used on the project:
1. **data** folder nested at the home of the project, where all needed jsons reside.
2. **sql_queries.py** contains all your sql queries, and is imported into the files bellow.
3. **create_tables.py** drops and creates tables. You run this file to reset your tables before each time you run your ETL scripts.
4. **test.ipynb** displays the first few rows of each table to let you check your database.
5. **etl.ipynb** reads and processes a single file from song_data and log_data and loads the data into your tables. 
6. **etl.py** reads and processes files from song_data and log_data and loads them into your tables. 
7. **README.md** current file, provides discussion on my project.

### Break down of steps followed

1º Wrote DROP, CREATE and INSERT query statements in sql_queries.py

2º Run in console
 ```
python create_tables.py
```

3º Used test.ipynb Jupyter Notebook to interactively verify that all tables were created correctly.

4º Followed the instructions and completed etl.ipynb Notebook to create the blueprint of the pipeline to process and insert all data into the tables.

5º Once verified that base steps were correct by checking with test.ipynb, filled in etl.py program.

6º Run etl in console, and verify results:
 ```
python etl.py
```

## ETL pipeline

Prerequisites: 
- Database and tables created

1. On the etl.py we start our program by connecting to the sparkify database, and begin by processing all songs related data.

2. We walk through the tree files under /data/song_data, and for each json file encountered we send the file to a function called process_song_file.

3. Here we load the file as a dataframe using a pandas function called read_json().

4. For each row in the dataframe we select the fields we are interested in:
    
    ```
    song_data = [song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration]
    ```
    ```
     artist_data = [artist_id, artist_name, artist_location, artist_longitude, artist_latitude]
    ```
5. And finally we insert this data into their respective databases.

6. Once all files from song_data are read and processed, we move on processing log_data.

7. We repeat step 2, but this time we send our files to function process_log_file.

8. We load our data as a dataframe same way as with songs data. 

9. We select rows where page = 'NextSong' only

10. We convert ts column where we have our start_time as timestamp in millisencs to datetime format. We obtain the parameters we need from this date (day, hour, week, etc), and insert everythin into our time dimentional table.

11. Next we load user data into our user table

12. Finally we lookup song and artist id from their tables by song name, artist name and song duration that we have on our song play data. The query used is the following:
    ```
    song_select = ("""
        SELECT song_id, artists.artist_id
        FROM songs JOIN artists ON songs.artist_id = artists.artist_id
        WHERE songs.title = %s
        AND artists.name = %s
        AND songs.duration = %s
    """)
    ```

13. The last step is inserting everything we need into our songplay fact table.
